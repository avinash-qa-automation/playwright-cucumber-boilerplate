# Contributing to Playwright Test Framework

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this framework as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Add tests for any new functionality
3. Ensure tests pass (`npm test`)
4. Update documentation
5. Submit pull request

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow async/await patterns
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods
- Follow the existing coding style
- Keep functions small and focused

## Testing Guidelines

- Add tests for any new features
- Update existing tests for modifications
- Use appropriate test categories (web/api/accessibility)
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Follow the Page Object Model for web tests

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the version number following semantic versioning
3. Add entry to CHANGELOG.md
4. The PR may be merged once you have the sign-off of another developer
